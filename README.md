## Documents
Currently there is no complete documents for this plugin, and I am working on this plugin and will wirte documents in the following days. But you can find some documets in [issues](https://github.com/Robot-Will/Stino/issues). I need your help to write documents.


## Installation
This version Stino can only be installed by manual installation. If you installed the previous version via Package Control, please remove or disable it firstly (see issue [#179](https://github.com/Robot-Will/Stino/issues/179)). Manual installation has only two steps:

1. Click menu `Preferences`->`Browse Packages...` to open the packages folder.

2. Download [zip file](https://github.com/Robot-Will/Stino/archive/new-stino.zip), and extract the folder to the packages folder, and the Arduino menu appears.
